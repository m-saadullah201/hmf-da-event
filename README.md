This application is meant to take any WhatsApp export chat log as .txt file, and runs a database query simulation
It clears, formats and stores data locally on your matchine and runs interesting queries on it to see cool valuable information about chat messages and their authors.

- Insert data.txt file in the data folder.
- Run main.py (after making the env and installing requirements or whatever, will be streamlined later)
